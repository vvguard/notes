FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a Python library developed by Facebook AI Research for efficient similarity search and clustering tasks on large datasets. It's designed to work with high-dimensional data, such as vectors representing images, audio, text embeddings, and more. 

- FAISS is optimized for speed and scalability. Some techniques used to enable fast similarity searches even on massive datasets are
  - index structures
  - quantization
  - multi-threading

- FAISS uses algorithms like cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, inner product, and L2 distance to measure similarity between vectors.
