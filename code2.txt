Hello JJ,

I hope this email finds you well.

During the PiuHI Transition call on 16th May, you requested a tentative date for when I will begin utilizing AWS for PHI rescoring.

I attempted to use AWS for this month in order to address some bugs and ensure code reusability. However, I discovered that AWS is reading data directly from the S3 bucket instead of querying it from the cloud database/HIVE (similar to Domino).

As mentioned in the PHI transition meeting, we have not yet completed the parity check on the output. I have highlighted the discrepancies in the outputs during the Transition meeting.

I wanted to provide you with an update on the next steps:
1) I will make the necessary code modifications to retrieve data from HIVE and perform the rescoring.
2) I will complete the parity checking by running both the AWS and Domino pipelines on the same day and comparing the outputs.

I estimate that these tasks will require one sprint to be completed.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further clarification.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
PK
